                                            If everything I did failed - which it doesn't, it actually succeeds - just
                                            the fact that I'm willing to fail is an inspiration. People are so scared to
                                            lose that they don't even try. Like, one thing people can't say is that I'm
                                            not trying, and I'm not trying my hardest, and I'm not trying to do the best
                                            way I know how.

                                            There’s nothing I really wanted to do in life that I wasn’t able to get good
                                            at. That’s my skill. I’m not really specifically talented at anything except
                                            for the ability to learn. That’s what I do. That’s what I’m here for. Don’t
                                            be afraid to be wrong because you can’t learn anything from a compliment.
                                            I always felt like I could do anything. That’s the main thing people are
                                            controlled by! Thoughts- their perception of themselves! They're slowed down
                                            by their perception of themselves. If you're taught you can’t do anything,
                                            you won’t do anything. I was taught I could do everything.
