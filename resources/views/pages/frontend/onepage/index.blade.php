                        since end of August 2021. BLIC was established with the aim of being a center for developing the
                        potential of
                        Budi Luhur University students in the field of Information Technology</p>

                Budi Luhur IT Club or commonly referred to as BLIC is a forum that is engaged in Information Technology.
                Rylan, Umar, Hafizh, and Fadillah is the founder of this club. The reason for the establishment of BLIC
                is
                because of the lack of support in learning in the field of Information Technology in developing the
                interests and talents of Budi Luhur's students. Therefore, we established BLIC as a forum to facilitate
                students in developing their potential in the field of Information Technology. BLIC is focuses based on
                study-case or real-project learning with the hope that students will be able to compete in the
                competition
                as well as in the industrial world and understand the workflow in the industrial world.

                    Web programming is an attempt to build a website-based application that can provide information for
                    internet users and is easy to access. In website development, just like with mobile-based programming,
                    website development also requires and uses a programming language to create a website. In each
                    development, it is usually divided into two, namely front-end and back-end. each of these two types
                    requires its own programming language, but they are related to each other.

                    Mobile programming is a process of making a mobile-based application for certain platforms such as
                    Android, iOS, and Windows phones. In the manufacturing process, this mobile-based application uses a
                    programming language that is devoted to creating mobile applications such as Java, Kotlin, Dart, Swift,
                    and so on. But for now, we only have development for the Android platform.

                    regularities, patterns, and relationships in large data sets

                    Cyber security is an action taken in an effort to protect a computer system from attacks or illegal
                    access. Referring to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), these cyber security measures
                    include tools, policies, security concepts, etc., that can be used to protect organizations, and user
                    assets. Cyber security leads to security and ensures that data is confidential and has the properties of
                    Confidentials, Integrity, and Availability which are the three points of the CIA Triad.
